/**
 * Drop the first `n` items from `data` based on the provided ordering criteria. This allows you to avoid sorting the array before dropping the items. The complexity of this function is *O(Nlogn)* where `N` is the length of the array.
 *
 * For the opposite operation (to keep `n` elements) see `takeFirstBy`.
 *
 * @param data - The input array.
 * @param n - The number of items to drop. If `n` is non-positive no items would be dropped and a *clone* of the input would be returned, if `n` is bigger then data.length no items would be returned.
 * @param rules - A variadic array of order rules defining the sorting criteria. Each order rule is a projection function that extracts a comparable value from the data. Sorting is based on these extracted values using the native `<` and `>` operators. Earlier rules take precedence over later ones. Use the syntax `[projection, "desc"]` for descending order.
 * @returns A subset of the input array.
 * @signature
 *   R.dropFirstBy(data, n, ...rules);
 * @example
 *   R.dropFirstBy(['aa', 'aaaa', 'a', 'aaa'], 2, x => x.length); // => ['aaa', 'aaaa']
