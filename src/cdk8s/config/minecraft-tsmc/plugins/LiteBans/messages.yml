# LiteBans messages.yml generated by version 2.12.4
#
# The following variables can be used in most messages that involve a punishment:
#
# Punishment specific variables
# $id - The ID of the punishment in the database.
# $idRandom - The ID of the punishment in the database, converted to a randomized, unpredictable, but fully reversible ID (example: 18535006 -> bdd405527). Secrets for this variable are stored in config.yml.
# $type - Type of punishment - ban, mute, warn, kick.
# $reason - the reason for the punishment
# $executor - the moderator's name, or their display name (/nick) if this is enabled in the configuration
# $executorUUID - the moderator's UUID
# $removalReason - the reason this punishment was removed (via /unban), if applicable
# $permanent - whether this punishment is permanent
# $ipban - whether this is an IP-ban
# $silent - whether this punishment was executed silently (-s)
# $active - whether this punishment is active
#
# Affected player specific variables
# $playerDisplayName - player display name. If display names are not enabled in the configuration or if the player's display name is not available in the message's context, the player's regular name will be used instead.
# $playerName - player name
# $playerUUID - UUID of affected player
# $playerIP - IP of affected player
# $playerServer - server of affected player - only accurate if they are online.
# $playerLoginDate - Last login date of affected player
# $playerBans - the amount of bans this player has received
# $playerMutes - the amount of mutes this player has received
# $playerWarnings - the amount of warnings this player has received
# $playerKicks - the amount of kicks this player has received
# $geoip - Country of affected player, requires GeoIP to be enabled in the configuration, won't work with imported bans
#
# Servers
# These variables represent a server.
# If the plugin is installed on Spigot, a server is represented by the "server_name" option in config.yml.
# If the plugin is installed on BungeeCord, a server is represented by their name in the "servers" section in the proxy's config.yml.
# $serverScope - the scope of the punishment (the server(s) it will affect)
# $serverOrigin - the origin of the punishment (the server/subserver it was placed on)
#
# Dates
# Example format: "2017-02-03", depends on time_format
# $dateStart - date the punishment was placed
# $dateEnd - date the punishment will expire, "forever" if permanent
# $dateRemoved - date the punishment was removed on, if applicable
#
# Durations
# Example format: "20 days, 5 hours, 2 minutes". If permanent, "forever", if expired, "expired" (both are configurable).
# $duration - time until expiry
# $originalDuration - the full duration of the punishment.
# $timeSince - time since placement
#
# Configured message variables
# These variables represent messages in this configuration (messages.yml)
# $base - banned_message_base
# $appealMessage - banned_message_appeal_message
#
# Global variables
# $activeBans, $activeMutes, $activeWarnings - total number of global active punishments
# $totalBans, $totalMutes, $totalWarnings, $totalKicks - total number of global punishments (including inactive ones)
#
# Chat variables
# $playerPrefix - Chat prefix of affected player
# $playerSuffix - Chat suffix of affected player
# $executorPrefix - Chat prefix of executor
# $executorSuffix - Chat suffix of executor
# Any message can be disabled by setting it to "". Empty messages will not be sent by the plugin.
# New lines can be added to any message using "\n" (example: "Line 1 \n Line 2").
# Hex colors are supported in all messages (#000000 - #FFFFFF)
#
# Hover text requires permission "litebans.json.hover_text" to view, players lacking permission will see messages without hover text.
# JSON example:
# muted: '&cYou are muted! {hoverText: #FF9900Reason: $reason \n&7$duration remaining}'
#
#
# https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/format/simpleDateFormat.html
# Example time format with hours + minutes:
# time_format: 'dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm'
# Example locales: [en, fr, de] (system locale is used by default)
time_format: yyyy-MM-dd
