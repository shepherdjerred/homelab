# Security Best Practices

## Secret Management
- **Never hardcode secrets in code or manifests**
- Use Kubernetes secrets with 1Password integration
- Store secrets in [src/cdk8s/secrets/](mdc:src/cdk8s/secrets) directory
- Implement proper secret rotation strategies
- Use dummy values for secrets in development environments

## Container Security
- **Prefer non-root containers** for all deployments
- Implement proper security contexts for all pods
- Use read-only root filesystems where possible
- Minimize container attack surface by using minimal base images
- Regularly update base images and dependencies

## Kubernetes RBAC
- Implement proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Create service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Regularly audit RBAC policies
- Document access control decisions

## Network Security
- Implement network policies where appropriate
- Restrict inter-pod communication to necessary services only
- Use proper ingress controls
- Consider service mesh for advanced networking security
- Document network architecture and security boundaries

## Pod Security Standards
- Follow Kubernetes Pod Security Standards
- Use security contexts consistently:
  - `runAsNonRoot: true`
  - `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`
  - `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
  - Drop unnecessary capabilities

## Image Security
- Pin Docker images with SHA hashes when possible
- Use trusted base images from official repositories
- Scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Implement image signing and verification
- Regularly update dependencies as managed by [renovate.json](mdc:renovate.json)

## Configuration Security
- Never expose sensitive configuration in ConfigMaps
- Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data
- Encrypt secrets at rest
- Implement proper backup encryption
- Consider external secret management solutions

## Monitoring & Auditing
- Enable Kubernetes audit logging
- Monitor for security events and anomalies
- Implement proper logging for security analysis
- Set up alerts for security violations
- Regularly review access logs

## Development Security
- Use security-focused linting rules
- Implement security testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Follow secure coding practices in TypeScript
- Review security implications of infrastructure changes
- Document security decisions and trade-offs

## Compliance & Standards
- Follow industry security standards
- Document compliance requirements
- Implement security baselines
- Regular security assessments
- Maintain security documentation
